They're BUILT IN! That's kind of the point of them right? No extra cost, no extra effort.</p> <p>Well, they're actually the BASIC routines that we're simply calling directly from assembly. If we have to overwrite basic in memory, we won't be able to use them anymore. (Need to confirm this. I'm sure there is a reason why you can't always use kernal routines.... but I could be wrong)</p> <p>OK, here is the code for the first method</p> <pre><code>*=$1000         ;load into $1000 (4096)\n\njsr $e544       ;jump to clear screen routine\nrts             ;ReTurn from Subroutine (End)\n</code></pre> <p>Now I shall go over each line and explain how the code works.\\ *=$1000 tells the assembler where to place our assembled code. This is our programs entry point.</p> <p>jsr $e544 This line tells the C64 to jump to memory address $e544. This memory address contains the kernal routines pointer.</p> <p>rts ends the program.</p> <p>Easy isn't it.</p> <p>Here is the code for the non-kernal method :-</p> <pre><code>*=$1000         ;load into $1000 (4096)\nldx #$00        ;load 0 into x register \nlda #$20        ;load $20(space char) into a register\nloop\nsta $0400,x     ;store contents of a ($20) into screen location $0400 + value of x\nsta $0500,x     ;store contents of a ($20) into screen location $0500 + value of x\nsta $0600,x     ;store contents of a ($20) into screen location $0600 + value of x\nsta $0700,x     ;store contents of a ($20) into screen location $0700 + value of x\ninx             ;increment x\nbne loop        ;while x doesn't equal 0, jump to loop\nrts             ;ReTurn from Subroutine (End)\n</code></pre> <p>*=$1000 tells the assembler where to place our assembled code. This is our programs entry point.</p> <p>ldx #$00 loads 0 directly into the x register</p> <p>lda #$20 loads the hex number 20 into the a register. $20 happens to be the character code for the space character. We're going to write this \"character\" into every memory address for the screen to wipe it.</p> <p>loop - a label to show the start of our loop. We can call this anything.</p> <p>sta $0400,x This is the first line we'll use to write to the screen. $0400 is the memory address for the top left corner of the screen. The \",x\" after the memory address tells the computer to add the value of the x register to the $0400 number. On the first run, x is 0 so the data ($20) is written to memory location $0400 + 0. As the program loops, x will have 1 added to it so will continue to increase until it rolls back to 0.</p> <p>The next few lines do the same function but at different screen locations (I will explain later).</p> <p>inx - increment x, Add 1 to whatever is in the x register.</p> <p>bne loop - While x doesn't equal 0, go back to the loop.</p> <p>rts ends the program.</p> <p>The C64 screen is 1000 characters in size but our loop only allows us to count to 255 before it flips back to zero.</p> <p>This is why we have those 4 similar lines, each one points to the screen location 255 bytes after the first.</p> <p>If we were to slow the C64 down enough, we would see that our program writes 4 characters to the screen each time it loops until 4 sets of 255 characters have been written.</p> <p>I hope that someone finds this useful and please get in touch if I have made any mistakes.</p>"},{"location":"blog/C64PSU/","title":"The infamous killer C64 PSU","text":"<p>Snappy title eh?

DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL PSU  - I Cannot stress this enough. If you are currently running your C64 on its original PSU, unplug it immediately.</p> <p>C64 power supplies can be found all over the place and generally, they either work or they don't. Those that do work, appear perfectly fine. All voltages read correctly and the C64 runs perfectly.  </p> <p>The PSU supplies two voltages, 9v AC and 5v DC. The 5v DC is provided by a regulator inside the PSU case (fed from the 9v AC transformer). It is this 5v regulator that causes all the damage.</p> <p>Often, when this regulator fails, it lets a much higher voltage through to the C64. This in turn, usually causes damage to chips inside the machine. In the 80s and 90s this wasn't a huge issue. There were spare parts galore (many of them still being produced). In 2024 however, genuine C64 chips are decreasing in supply to the point where people are developing replacement chips using modern methods. As good as some of these are though, it's still much better to retain the original chips and one of the ways to enable that is to never use the original C64 PSU.</p> <p>Also, there is no warning of the failure. It works and then pop, suddenly it doesn't.

Commodore 64","text":"<p>Growing up, I had a Commodore 64 (after a Dragon 32 and ZX Spectrum) and to this day it remains my favourite computer. That may be because I never had an Atari ST or Amiga back then so never knew what I was missing out on. Regardless, I still love the humble C64 and have decided that the 30 years since I last used the machine is quite long enough and I should try to learn all the stuff I wasn't clever enough to understand back then\u2026..not that I\u2019m any more intelligent now mind.</p> <p>There are so many great tools available these days for writing C64 code that you could be up and running at no cost in around 5-10 mins. IDEs, cross compilers, debuggers, everything you can think of is out there and can be used but for now, I'm going to use the \"real\" thing. By that I mean either a real C64 or an emulator, not a PC based development tool.</p> <p>The reason for this is because I feel that by using the C64 directly, I'll gain a better understanding of the machine.</p> <p>I actually started working on this article many weeks ago but kept on changing how I did things and then having to re-write parts. This is probably better for anyone wanting to follow along because at least now I have a fixed set of methods and tools whereas previously I would have been flicking between different applications.</p> <p>I'll use the term C64 from now on as a blanket term. Obviously there are many ways to facilitate this, from real hardware, emulator, replicas, etc. I have settled on 3 main methods for now (with a 4th planned) :-</p> <p>Real Commodore C64c - My own machine, stock firmware, no mods. Custom PSU DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL</p> <p>Kung Fu Flash cartridge - Recently purchased. Pi1541 - Bare PCB arrived this morning so will be built by the time this is published.</p> <p>MiSTer FPGA - I've had this for a few years now and absolutely love it. Expect some articles in the near future about it. The C64 core on the MiSTer is simply amazing. Great accuracy and the framework features add so many quality of life improvements while working with C64 media.</p> <p>Emulator - I tend to use Vice or Denise when using an emulator. Both are great and they're to hand on my laptop when I'm out and about or want to lay on the sofa and code.</p> <p>The C64 Maxi - I'm thinking of ordering one of these mainly for the keyboard. When using the MiSTer or an emulator, I use a Corsair K65 and have put stickers on some keycaps to identify special keys. I'd likely use the Maxi most of all because it blends the keyboard with the QOL improvements of emulation.</p> <p>Ok, on with the show. If I were writing this back in the 80s or 90s on real hardware, I'd probably have to choose software that most users already had or include a listing for it. I'm not. It's 2023 and emulators are filled to the brim with all the hardware you could wish for. The internet is awash with any software package you could imagine and you can find pretty much any information you desire either via web search or by downloading old C64 books. Life is just god damn peachy!</p> <p>Having owned an Action Replay mk6 cartridge back in the day, this was my first choice of utility cartridge. It was never unplugged from my machine in the 90s and it's always mounted when I run emulation. This time, it's different. For reasons that I will explain in a different article, I've opted for the Super Snapshot V5 cartridge.</p> <p>Regarding software, I've played with several different options but ultimately settled on Turbo Macro Pro (TMP). Initially I was put off by the menu system. From the few YouTube videos that I saw, it looked to me like I'd have to learn complicated shortcuts and command which I didn't fancy. Then I put my big boy pants on, looked at the docs and got stuck in.</p> <p>I did spend some time using Mikro Assembler by Supersoft and got on really well with it. I just found that TMP helped me to keep my code more organised. I had a quick look at the PAL assembler too but decided against it.</p> <p>Blank disks. I always keep a blank.d64 file handy and make copies when I need new disks. Some emulators have a feature to create a new blank disk and insert it which is nice. MiSTer doesn\u2019t have this feature hence the files.</p> <p>Documentation is another thing I've taken into account. I keep copies of these files with me while working with the C64 :-</p> <p>C64 User Manual C64 Programmers Reference Manual Super Snapshot V5 manual TMP Documentation</p> <p>This list will no doubt grow over time but it's what I consider the bare minimum for the time being. I did think about providing a zip file with everything included but quite honestly, these things are so easy to find that it's just not worth it. </p> <p>Most software / documentation can be found here :-\\ CSDB\\ Internet Archive\\</p> <p>Obviously this is just my choice and you are free to substitute any of the above should you choose to follow along. Many people nowadays use JiffyDOS / DolphinDOS or their own choice of utility cartridge. That is fine as most of what I will be covering will transfer between different methods.</p> <p>To each their own and may their C64 journey be eventful.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Misterbuild/","title":"MiSTer FPGA - Initial Setup","text":"<p>This guide assumes you know what a MiSTer FPGA is, what it does and what it comprises of.</p> <p>Before we can use the MiSTer, we need to prepare the micro SD card with the MiSTer image.</p> <p>Hardware you will need :-</p> <ul> <li>DE-10 Nano</li> <li>Micro SD card</li> <li>USB-OTG Cable</li> <li>Powered USB hub - Can be un-powered if just using with standard keyboard and mouse however not recommended.</li> <li>USB keyboard</li> <li>OPTIONAL RAM module - This is technically optional as the MiSTer platform itself works perfectly well without it as do many cores.

We have heard from many of our SNAPSH0T64 and SUPER SNAPSHOT customers and have taken into consideration all of the comments and suggestions that we have received. The result is SUPER SNAPSHOT V5.</p> <p>We feel this cartridge represents a significant enhancement over previous versions and over what is available on the market today. We have strived to make this cartridge not only the best archiver on die market but to also make it an indispensable utility. To this end we have included along with the snapshot utility: a fast loading utility (TURBO DOS), a dos wedge, a screen dump utility, machine language monitor, REU support, utility menu, copier system, file management system, file readers, preprogrammed function keys plus many other useful utilities. With afffll of these features, there should be no reason for unplugging your cartridge. And this is only the beginning. That's right, future versions of the cartridge will include other valuable utilities. But where does that leave you since you have bought this version? The answer is .... in a great spot. SUPER SNAPSHO's unique design allows it to be openended. That means that you will be able to update to the latest version very easily and at a very reasonable cost.

Pressing the appropriate key (1,2,3 or 4) beside the desired buffer option will toggle the buffer on or off. If you try to turn ON a buffer source that is not there, a NOT PRESENT message is displayed. Pressing SPACE will return you to the main disk copy menu.</p> <p>(M) - SINGLE DRIVE COPY Selects between single and dual drive copy mode. The default is single but pressing this button will switch to the dual mode and the message \"DUAL DRIVE COPY\" will appear. NOTE: You can only use the two drive option between similar drives! For example 1541 to 1541 is allowed as is 1581 to 1581 but 1541 to 1581 is NOT allowed. If you press the MODE key, a second status line will appear below the F1/F2 option.</p> <p>(F) - FIX DRIVE If you have two disk drives and they are both device 8, you can temporarily change the device number of one of them using this option. To do so select this option and follow the prompts.</p> <p>(K) - DISK COMMAND This allows you to send any command to the specified drive. The desired drive is chosen using the F1/F2 key (see below). When you press K a \"&gt;\" will appear at the bottom of the screen with the cursor flashing beside it. Just type the desired wedge symbol.</p> <p>(X) - EXIT Takes you from the DISK COPIER back to the opening menu of SUPER SNAPSHOT.</p> <p>F1/F2 - SOURCE DRIVE Selects the source drive.</p> <p>F3/F4 - DESTINATION DRIVE Selects the destination drive. This line appears only when you chose the dual drive mode (pressing the M key).</p> <p>F5/F6 - STARTING TRACK Selects the starting track. F5 increments the track number while F6 decrements the track number.</p> <p>F7/F8 - ENDING TRACK Selects the ending track.

Let's go through the options and features specific to each version.</p> <p>SINGLE DRIVE VERSION:</p> <p>1) Starting Track No.: Press 1 to enter the changes. Defaults to 01 but any track number from 1 to 80 may be selected.</p> <p>2) Ending Track No.: Press 2 to enter changes. Defaults to 35, but any track number from 1 to 80 may be selected. Please note that tracks 41-80 should only be programmed while using a 1571 formatted disk. This copy is made with out actually flipping the disk. Although you may select tracks 1-80, we suggest copying tracks 1-35 and then tracks 41-75. This will save time in most cases.</p> <p>3) Density Detection: Defaults to OFF and may be toggled ON by pressing the 3 key. (Don't use this feature unless you suspect whole track non-standard density. Superkit 1541TM for example.)</p> <p>4) Drive No.: Press 4 and select 08,09,10, or 11. </p> <p>F1/F3: View Disk Directory of copy drive.</p> <p>C: Begin Copy process. Follow on screen prompts.</p> <p>RESTORE: You may abort the copy process at any time by hitting RESTORE. If you abort while the drive is active, we suggest that you turn the drive off and on again.</p> <p>One drive copier hints and tips.</p> <p>We suggest you use default values when copying any commercial program, protected or not. If the copy fails, set the end track to 40 and recopy. Be sure to write protect the copy before attempting to test it. Some programs will fail if the write protect is missing. The Shotgun II contains our system for copying RapidlokTM protected disks. This protection scheme is touchy, but we have had excellent results. If the copier prompts you to reinsert the Shotgun II while copying, it is going back to pick up the proper RapidlokTM copier. Again, just follow on screen prompts. One final word on RapidlokTM protection. If the copier has prompted you to reinsert the Shotgun II,you do have a RapidlokTM protect ed disk. If your backup fails, attempt again but first be absolutely sure that ALL, and we mean ALL peripherals are disconnected from your system. Strip the system down to a keyboard, a monitor, and one disk drive. This also includes special copy cables, chips, and other such hardware. After a successful copy has been made, start adding a piece or two back to the system (one at a time) until the problem has been identified. It may be as simple as a modem and as sneaky as a second drive on line but not even powered in. Companies known to use RapidlokTM are: AccoladeTM, Avalon HillTM, MicroproseTM, AvantageTM, CapcomTM, DreamriderTM. Others probably exist. Finally, we want you to know that it is normal for the system to reset to BASIC after copying RapidlokTM protected titles.

Key protection is self evident. Programs that use the disk drive's memory are easily identified as well. To do so, load in the original program and when it has started, turn your drive off and then on again. If the program crashes or locks up when it tries to access the disk (the drive will not come on at ALL) you can safely assume that it uses special routines that were placed in the drive's ram.</p> <p>To determine whether the program is using a late protection check, make an unprotected copy of the original disk (using the fast copier included on the parameter disk).

This is done so that SUPER SNAPSHOT will only save that memory which is actually part ofthe program being backed up and therefore minimize the size of the files that will be saved. This feature will be used by you 99% of the time. However, it is not necessary to pre-configure memory. If you don't it only means that your files will be larger.

If you have a 1525 or compatible (such as the Gemini II) you should choose the 1525 setting. If, on the other hand, you are using an Epson or Epson compatible (as a Panasonic 1092) you would choose the Epson setting. Should you be fortunate enough to own an Epson JX-80 or STAR Rainbow, you have the option of printing out your screens in full color just by choosing the COLOR option. Commodore 1526 or 802 users would select the 1526 setting. SUPER SNAPSHOT has the ability to store custom printer drivers on its ram and SCREEN-COPY has the ability to access these drivers directly.

IC000 D000 Interpret memory from $C000 to $D000.</p> <p>IO - display IO registers eg. IO Displays the status of the IO registers at the point the program was interrupted.</p> <p>L - load a file eg. L\"file\",08 or LS \"file\",08 Load a file from device 8. The S is optional and signifies a slow load. This is used for loading directly into the snapshot image under any ROM configuration.</p> <p>M - memory display eg. M 4000 5000 Display memory from $4000 to $5000.</p> <p>O - output to device eg. O4 Output can be to screen, printer or disk. The default is 3,7 (screen). To output to a printer the command would be O4.</p> <p>R - register display eg. R Display the contents of the various registers. These contents will represent the status at the time the program was interrupted.</p> <p>S - save a file eg. S \"name\",08,1000,2000 or SS \"name\",08,1000,2000 Saves a program called name which resided from memory location $1000 to $2000 to device 8.

This means that if, for example, you wanted to display  memory at 005F you need only type M 5F instead of M005F.</p> <p>Another is the ability to enter POKES into memory through the monitor. For example if you wanted to POKE 53281,0 the equivalent monitor command would be :+532810. The colon is the memory modify command and the + converts the following decimal figures into hex.</p> <p>The F (fill memory) and H (hunt for specified value) commands will default to BB (our memory pattern) if  you do not specify a value.</p> <p>The monitor can also be accessed through your machine language program by first entering the monitor via the SUB-SYSTEM MENU (or F8). Once in the monitor, enter the set break vector command (BR). The message -DONE- will appear. Now you can exit back to BASIC by typing XB. From now on you can enter the monitor from within your machine language program through the BRK instruction.</p> <p>There are many potential and varied uses for this utility. For example, in England it is very popular to make custom changes in programs to give indefinite lives, unlimited fire power, etc.</p> <p>NOTE: There is an extra feature in the SUB-SYSTEM MENU that is not displayed on the screen. Pressing the letter T will toggle TURBO DOS on or off. The result of pressing the key is shown at the top of the window. This is merely a convenience feature in that it will turn on our fast dos enabling you to fast save the program in memory if, example, the program happened to turn the dos off while loading.</p>"},{"location":"manuals/SS5/#441a-ml-track-and-sector-editor","title":"4.41a M/L TRACK AND SECTOR EDITOR","text":"<p>Also included within the monitor is the ability to read and write sectors directly to and from a disk.

The two numbers following U1 and U2 are the track and sector respectively. Remember that unless you prefix these numbers with a V, they will be interpreted as being hexadecimal. For example, the following are equivalent commands to read the first sector in the directory ofa 1541 disk:</p> <p>U1 +18 +01 - read track 18, sector 1.</p> <p>U1 12 1 - read track 18 (=$12), sector 1.</p> <p>If no optional address is specified, both U1 and U2 will default to address $C000 (ending at $C0FF).

It is the same method used in synthesizer keyboards and compact disks. It could actually be called a \"computer tape recorder.\" This method is becoming more and more popular in 64 software. With our SAMPLE MONITOR we have given you the ability to capture these samples and with the PLAYER module on your SYSTEM DISK, you can incorporate them right into your own programs!</p> <p>Whenever you hear a voice or a very realistic sound in a game, chances are it is a sound sample. Many of these sounds can be captured for use in your own demo programs. You can even make music with them, plus simulate the sampled effects popular in dance music.</p> <p>When you suspect that this method is being used in your software, try to press the cartridge button when it is being played. Choose the MONITOR option from the SUB-SYSTEM MENU and then choose SAMPLE MONITOR There is no way of automatically detecting where the sample is and what format it is in so you will have to help the program accomplish this. It is actually very easy and is done through experimentation with the different parameters. Chances are the settings will be similar to those shown so simply press'P to listen through the entire memory. If you hear the sound from the program at all, you are in luck! If not, you will have to experiment with the various fields. You can select the desired field by using the N (next field) and L (last field) keys.</p> <p>START ADDR and END ADDR - If there is a lot of noise before the sound is heard, you ha using the N and L keys. Adjust the value on the screen by using SHIFT/I (increase) or SHIFT/D (decrease) and then try playing it again. Continue adjusting until the sound starts to play immediately. If you can come dose to the starting address but are still getting a bit of noise at the beginning use I or D alone to fine tune the address. You can change the END ADDR (ending address) the same way. Now you have the sample cornered! If at any time you wish to stop the sound from playing, press A to abort</p> <p>FREQUENCY - If at this point it sounds like a record player at very high or low speed, you can fix it by adjusting the FREQUENCY setting. A lower number will result in the sound being played faster while a higher number will result in the sound being played slower.</p> <p>FINE DIR -The sound may still sound distorted, with a ringing tone in the background. If this is the case try changing the FINE DIR from + to - (or visa versa).</p> <p>COARSE DIR - If all this time it sounded like it may be something but wasn't quite recognizable, it may be playing backwards! Use the COARSE DIR setting to fix this (by pressing I). The START ADDR and END ADDR will swap places because now you are playing from the end to the beginning.</p> <p>TYPE - If after all this you are still not getting anything, try changing the type from 1 bit to 4 bit. Now go through the process again and if you still don't get anything then try the 8 bit type selection.</p> <p>These instructions were found to lead to the quickest road of success, but only practice will improve your speed. If all your effort leads to no success then the sample is probably a non-standard format which means it is stored in a very unique and complicated way. For these programs there is a chance that a parameter will be developed and made available on our BBS for downloading. A parameter is a program that will change these non- standard samples into a standard one.</p> <p>To save a lot of time you should be able to recognize the sample type fairly quick. To this end we have included samples of all formats on the SYSTEM DISK. These can form the basis of your sample collection.</p> <p>If you have been able to locate and isolate a sample, insert a blank disk and press S. The prompt FILENAME: will appear with the default SAMPLE given. You can change the default to any name that you wish up to 14 characters long. The sample will be saved into two files with prefixes of D. and I. respectively. The first file contains the sample itself while the second contains the settings used. The D. file is not likely to be more than 202 blocks in size.</p> <p>As you can see, capturing a sample is quite fun but it also take some time. Things would be much better if everyone shared their findings with others. Leave a message on our BBS describing what kind of program your sample is from, the nature of the sound, the settings that you used and we will forward it to the other users and give you the full credit for the contribution. Remember...updates and special utilities are available for downloading.</p> <p>Wouldn't it be great if everyone used the same format for sound samples? There are currently 10 different combinations of FINE DIR, COARSE DIR, and TYPE plus some non-standard formats. Now that can be the source of a lot of confusion. We have included a program on the SYSTEM DISK called CONVERTER to help with the problem.</p> <p>First you must understand that TYPE'S are very different from one another but COARSE DIR and FINE DIR are simply variations of a TYPE. There should be only one format for each TYPE. Luckily there is already a standard for 8 bit TYPEs and it is called IFF 8SVX. It stands for Interchange File Format for 8 bit sampled voice and it is used on the Amiga as well as other brands of computers. IFF really refers to a group of standards which includes ways of storing pictures. The 8SVX is for storing sampled sounds. Unfortunately, 8 bit sampled sounds are unsuitable for smaller computers, such as the 64, since they are more accurate than can be played on an unmodified 64.</p> <p>The most suitable format for the 64 is the 4 bit sample. Unfortunately limited Eprom space as well as technical considerations make it quite impractical to save directly into the 4 bit format. You will have to convert all your SAMPLE MONITOR files to this format using the CONVERTER utility. Once the files have been converted they are then suitable for use with the PLAYER module (section 12.3) and for use with SUPER SNAPSHOTSUDESHOW CREATOR PLUS.</p>"},{"location":"manuals/SS5/#444-character-set-monitor","title":"4.44 CHARACTER SET MONITOR","text":"<p>Option 4 of the MONITOR MENU is our CHARACTER SET MONITOR.

To activate, just type &gt;\u00a3.</p> <p>The following is the list of new commands and their syntax.</p> COMMAND SYNTAX APPEND \u00a3AP This command will add a second basic program to the one already in memory by \"appending\" it. You will be asked for the name of the file that you want to append. NOTE: Make sure that the appended file has its lowest line number GREATER than the highest line number of the original program. Pressing only RETURN as the filename aborts the append. AUTONUMBER \u00a3AU,ST, INC Begins supplying line numbers automatically, from a specified starting line (ST) and line increment (INC). NOTE: Pressing \u00a3AU ONLY will use the following defaults: ST=100 and INC=10. Pressing RETURN by itself on a line terminates the function. Subsequent usage of the \u00a3AU will continue from the next logical line number. AUTODATA \u00a3AD,ST, INC As above, except that \"DATA\" is printed after each line number. To terminate the function, simply backspace over the word \"DATA\", and press RETURN. DELETE \u00a3DE,ST-FIN Deletes a range of lines from ST(art) to FIN(ish). DUMP \u00a3DUMP After breaking from a program, DUMP will list all variables and values used in the program. KILL \u00a3K Disengages BASIC PLUS. MENU \u00a3MENU Brings up the SUPER SNAPSHOT SUB-SYSTEM MENU. Choosing 7 from that menu returns you to the point where the menu command was invoked. MERGE \u00a3MERGE You will be prompted for the filename of the program that you want merged with the program in memory. This command does a true merge! Repeated line numbers will be overwritten. Pressing only RETURN as the filename aborted the merge. OLD \u00a3OLD Restores newed program. PRINTON \u00a3PRN Diverts output from printer to screen. PRINTOFF \u00a3PRO Restores output to screen. ENUM \u00a3RE,STFIN,NST,INC Renumbers a range of lines (ST-FIN) with a specified new starting number (NST)and increment (INC). Also, \u00a3RE, NST, INC is permitted. TRACEON \u00a3TRN Enables trace feature. Prints program line numbers at top right of screen as program executes. Excellent for debugging. TRACEOFF \u00a3TRO Disables trace feature."},{"location":"manuals/SS5/#110-bootsector-support","title":"11.0 BOOTSECTOR SUPPORT","text":"<p>Your SUPER SNAPSHOT cartridge has a facility built in which, we feel, you will find very useful. You now have the option to make your favorite programs boot right from power-up, just like a Commodore 128! What's more, your 64 will now support the BOOT command.</p> <p>This is how it works. On the SYSTEM DISK is a program called BOOTSECTOR MAKER Simply load and run the file and you will be asked to insert your target disk and for the name of the program that you wish to auto-boot. Pressing RETURN will start the process. What will happen is that there will be a special command written to track 1, sector 0. When the process is finished the message \"BOOTSECTOR INSTALLED!\" will appear. From now on this disk will be auto-bootable. There is no reason to worry about the auto-boot process overwriting A sector that is in use as the program checks for this. Also, when the sector is modified by the BOOTSECTOR MAKER, the bam is updated to show that the sector is being used.</p> <p>The auto-boot feature can be invoked in several ways. Pressing F7 from the opening screen will exit to basic and the auto-boot sequence will be executed. Issuing the BOOT command from basic will cause the cartridge to attempt an auto-boot. The third means of auto-booting is designed for all those people running a BBS on their 64. When the system is powered up, an internal timer will count down sixty seconds. If at the end of that time there hasn't been a key pressed, the system will automatically exit to basic and attempt to auto-boot the disk in the drive.</p> <p>NOTE: When using the auto-boot feature, make sure that there is a disk in the drive. If no disk is present and you are using an older 1541, you will here the infamous head knock associated with these drives. As long as there is a disk in the drive, the auto-boot sequence WILL NOT CAUSE A HEAD KNOCK The auto-boot feature works with the 1541 (and compatibles) and the 1581.</p>"},{"location":"manuals/SS5/#120-super-snapshot-system-disk","title":"12.0 SUPER SNAPSHOT SYSTEM DISK","text":"<p>As you are aware by now, the SYSTEM DISK contains our nibbler, disk copiers, parameter copier and BOOTSECTOR MAKER Also included on the parameter disk is a slideshow demo (side two of the disk) and two TURBO*25 modules. The slideshow demo is just that. It is a slideshow that was produced using the SUPER SNAPSHOT SLIDESHOW CREATOR PLUS.

The first module (TURBO25 CONVERTER) will do the converting. Simply choose your source and destination drives, press continue and follow the prompts. The whole process takes about one minute. Only programs that have been saved as 1 file can be converted. NOTE: This module works with 1541 and compatible drives.</p> <p>The second module (TURBO25 FILE UTILITIES) allows you to manipulate these special files. Since our TURBO25 incorporates a non-standard format, regular dos commands will not work on them. For example, the regular scratch command will not erase this new type of file, so in order to remove a TURBO25 file from a disk (without reformatting) you must use the TURBO25 SCRATCH option.</p> <p>Also included on the utilities module is an option to install a disk based turbo loader. Simply select the INSTALL TURBOLOADER option and follow the prompts. This loader works best with files that have been converted to the TURBO*25 format. It will work with regular files but not as effectively as the cartridge based loader.</p>"},{"location":"manuals/SS5/#122-sprite-editor","title":"12.2 SPRITE EDITOR","text":"<p>Another handy utility included on the SYSTEM DISK is our SPRITE EDITOR. To use it just type /SS.SED and press return. When it has loaded in type RUN.</p> <p>The SPRITE EDITOR is comprised of five separate menus all of which will help you to create your own custom sprites or modify those saved with the SPRITE MONITOR found on SUPER SNAPSHOT. You now can begin to \u2022 appreciate the sophistication of this utility.</p> <p>The following is a brief description of each of the five menus:</p> <p>EDITOR MENU: This is the screen that first appears after the program has loaded. From here you can create your own custom sprites. The sprite is created by moving the cursor around the display area and flipping the bits on or off (using the fire button or space bar). The cursor can be controlled through a joystick in port two or through the cursor arrows. Eight sprites can be displayed at all times on this screen.</p> <p>The smaller box in the lower right part of the screen displays the information relevant to the current sprite. Most of the information is self evident with exception of the \"Sens.\" line. This refers to the speed at which the cursor will move when controlled by a joystick. Increasing the sensitivity (C=+) will make the cursor move slower. Decreasing the sensitivity (C=-) will make the cursor move more quickly. NOTE: The cursor moves at only one speed (normal) when controlled by the cursor keys.</p> <p>HELP SCREEN: The HELP SCREEN is accessed by pressing the Commodore key and H at the same time. What appears is a menu which describes each of the options available in the EDITOR menu along with how to access the other menus in the system.</p> <p>The options available under the heading \"Commodore Keys\" are accessed by holding down the Commodore key and pressing the indicated key.</p> <p>DISK OPERATIONS MENU: From this menu you can load from or save to any drive device. The current sprite (the one in the work area of the EDITOR menu) is also displayed. Also from within this screen you can have the current sprite (the one in the work area of the EDITOR screen) saved to disk as DATA statements. The line numbers for the statements are 6000 and above. You can append these statements to an already existing basic program, by using the APPEND command available in the BASIC PLUS module (section 10.0), as long as your first program has line numbers less than 6000.</p> <p>When loading or saving sprites, the prefix \"smon\" is automatically used. Just type in the rest of the desired sprite name. This prefix is used so as to provide a convenient link with the SPRITE MONITOR.</p> <p>The Library command (D) will produce a listing of all files on the disk that have a prefix of \"smon.\"</p> <p>COLOR MENU: The colors used in the characters, background, foreground, etc. can be altered using this screen.</p> <p>ANIMATION MENU: This screen allows you to animate any or all of the eight sprites present on the EDITOR screen. This allows you to more easily create animation sequences by actually allowing you to see how it will look.</p>"},{"location":"manuals/SS5/#123-sound-sample-player","title":"12.3 SOUND SAMPLE PLAYER","text":"<p>This module allows you to use the samples captured by the SAMPLE MONITOR in your own basic programs. Reading this section carefully will ensure ease of use and enjoyment of this unique utility.</p> <p>INITIALIZATION</p> <p>The first line of your basic program should read:</p> <pre><code>ML=16384:T=17664:IFPEEK(ml)&lt;&gt;76THENLOAD\"PLAYER\",8,1\n</code></pre> <p>The variable ML points to the start address of the machine language program,and T points to an information table. The next statement loads in the m/1 program. The next line of your program should be: SYS(m/1). This initialization is necessary before doing any other functions with the m/1 and should only be executed once in your program.</p> <p>THE LOAD COMMAND</p> <p>To load a sample into memory use the following: POKE186,DEVICE:SYSML+3,(FN) where DEVICE is the drive that you wish to load from, FN is any string expression that evaluates to a valid filename. All samples are referenced by their information file which is named with the 'C/ prefix. This is one of the files created by the converter. For example, SYSml+3,\"C.FINAL FRONTIER\" will load that sample. You can store up to 16 samples at once providing that you don't run out of memory. The first file loaded in is referred to as INSTRUMENT 1, the next file would be INSTRUMENT 2 and so on.</p> <p>THE PLAY COMMAND The basic format of the play command is:</p> <pre><code>SYSML+6,(INSTRUMENT#),(STARTPOINT),(LENGTH),(SPEED),(DIRECTION/REPEATS)\n</code></pre> <p>If you use 0 for every parameter (except instrument number), defaults will be used. The simplest play command then is: SYSML+6,1,0,0,0,0. This command will play the sound exactly as you heard it in the SAMPLE MONITOR or as how it sounded as an IFF file. The INSTRUMENTS is the same one described with the LOAD command and will range from 1 to 16. It and all other play parameters may be any numeric expression.</p> <p>The next parameter is the point where the sample starts playing. The larger the number here, the more will be cut off from the beginning of the sample. It may range from 0 to the length of the sample -1. The next parameter is th\u00a3 number of bytes that will be played from the start point onwards. The larger the number here,the longer the sound is played. The next parameter is exactly like FREQUENCY in SAMPLE MONITOR, the lower the number the faster the sound will be played.</p> <p>The final parameter is a combination of play direction (whether it is played forward or backwards) and number of repeats (how many times the sample will play with no silence in between). Any number from 0-127 will play the sample forwards that many times. Add 128 to this number to play the sample backwards the same number of times.</p> <p>ERROR RETURNS  </p> <p>Several problems may occur when loading or playing samples. After a load or play command, ER=PEEK(10) will put the error number in the variable ER. The error numbers have the following meaning:</p> <p>ERRORS DURING A PLAY COMMAND</p> <p>1 - You used an instrument number that has not been loaded. 2 - Compression flag&lt;&gt;0. (This is reserved for future versions)  </p> <p>ERRORS DURING A PLAY COMMAND  </p> <p>3 - The sample that you tried to load was not a CONVERTER file. 4 - The sample you tried to load was not an IFF file (basically the same as error 3). 5 - Device not present. 6 - Out of memory (you can still play as much of the sample as was loaded). 7 - Reserved for future versions.  </p> <p>A value of 0 always means everything is fine after executing the LOAD/PLAY command.</p> <p>THE INFORMATION TABLE</p> <p>When experimenting with playing for various lengths you may wonder what the largest number you can use is. That is why the length of each instrument is stored in a table along with the other default information. This table starts at location T which was mentioned as being the first line of your program.</p> <p>Given an instrument number called I, you can find the length with this expression: L=PEEK(T+I2)+PEEK(T+I2+1)*256</p> <p>The FREQUENCY is found with: P=PEEK(T+32+I2)+PEEK(T+32+I2+1)*256</p> <p>Three other tables are kept which may be of use to more advanced programmers.</p> <p>The actual start address of the sample in memory is found with: SA=PEEK(T+64+I2)+PEEK(T+64+I2+1)*256</p> <p>The sample type (with 0 meaning 1 bit, and 3 meaning 4 bit) is found with: TY=PEEK(T+96+I)</p> <p>The compression type can be found with: FL=PEEK(T+112+I) with 0 meaning no compression. This is reserved for future expansion.</p> <p>Finally, the number of instruments is stored at location 2. It can be determined with: N=PEEK(2)</p> <p>TECHNICAL INFORMATION</p> <p>The ML resides from $4000-$467F. The sample buffer runs from $4680 to $FFFF. Zero page locations 2,10,251-254 are used as well as the cassette buffer.</p>"},{"location":"manuals/SS5/#130-using-the-1571","title":"13.0 USING THE 1571","text":"<p>The 1571 is a great drive but, in our opinion, very rarely used its full potential.

What many 1571 owners don't know is that this drive can be used in the 1571 mode while working with a C64. Since SUPER SNAPSHOT has a set of fast communication routines installed to work specifically with the 1571 mode we felt it wise to list the various modes of the 1571, how to access them and what the results are. All the commands will be given as if issued from BASIC using the wedge.</p> <p>. &gt;U0&gt;M1 - sets the 1571 to 1571 mode. Both sides of the disk are utilized with storage being 1328 blocks. SUPER SNAPSHOT uses 1571 routines in this mode.</p> <p>. &gt;U0&gt;M0 - sets the 1571 to 1541 mode (defaults to this mode when working with a C64).

Here are a couple of the most common questions.</p> <p>Q - \"I can't reload a file that has been snapshotted without SUPER SNAPSHOT bing in place.\"</p> <p>A - What has happened here is that you loaded in the original program with SUPER SNAPSHOT in place. The load vectors were changed by SUPER SNAPSHOT and now the backup is looking for the cartridge. The solution is quite simple. Load the original program with the cartridge disabled and then use the snapshot feature. Now your backup will load in with or without SUPER SNAPSHOT in place.</p> <p>Q - \"I just received my cartridge and it doesn't work properly. Have I got a defective unit?\"</p> <p>A - Most likely you don't have a defective unit at all. The problem probably lies in your power pack. Commodore power packs are notorious for being flaky, especially after they are a few years old. This is not to say that we never have a defective unit but we do test EVERY ONE of them before they are shipped out. If you are having problems with your cartridge, try it out on a friend's computer first. If the cartridge still doesn't work then it is probably faulty. If the cartridge works on your friend's computer then you have a bad power pack.</p> <p>Q- Now we are anticipating this next one. \"My 128 (in 64 mode) does not seem to work with SUPER SNAPSHOT and an REU plugged in at the same time.\"</p> <p>A - There are a few older 128s out there (manufactured prior to October 1985) that have a hardware flaw. These units do not have enough power being delivered to the cartridge port and when both SUPER SNAPSHOT and the REU are plugged in, the system will occasionally lock up. There is a fix to this problem and your local Commodore dealer should be able to repair the unit with little difficulty. This problem does not manifest itself with the 64, newer 128s or 128D.</p>"},{"location":"manuals/SS5/#170-bbs-support","title":"17.0 BBS SUPPORT","text":"<p>We have expanded our support network to include a 24 hour Bulletin Board Service.
