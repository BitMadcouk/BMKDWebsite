# Manuals / Books / Docs

Here you will find a small selection of manuals etc for various subjects.  
These have all been converted into Markdown in order to make navigation easier.  
Plese note that this is a manual process and is not quite complete for all documents. There may still be errors.

As all of the file are [available on Github](https://github.com/BitMadcouk/BMKDWebsite) feel free to submit corrections.

Yes, there is only 1 currently but I plan to add to the list gradually.
